# FGC Team China Codes
This is repository is used for FIRST Global Challenge 2024 [Feeding the Future](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoT_eVi7vQ0)

To explore this repository, go to [src directory](https://github.com/Allenyang16/FGC2024-TeamChina/tree/master/TeamCode/src/main/java/org/firstinspires/ftc/teamcode)

Our hardwares are instantiated in the subsystems, and commands contain the actions we need to use during the whole match.

For more information, go to our [Chief Delphi](https://www.chiefdelphi.com/) to ask more questions!

1. What **IDE** are you using?

   We use [Android Studio](https://ftc-docs.firstinspires.org/en/latest/programming_resources/android_studio_java/Android-Studio-Tutorial.html) and Java to code our robots. And you need to connect your device with Control Hub to upload your codes.

2. What **third-party libraries** are you using?

   In this project, we utilized
   
   + [FTCLib](https://docs.ftclib.org/ftclib), which users can use their FRC-like interfaces.
   + [FTC Dashboard](https://acmerobotics.github.io/ftc-dashboard/), which users can easily output desired values and change the related parameters while debugging their codes or hardwares.

3. What advanced **controls** are you using?

   For our FGC 2024 robot, we used [PID controller](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/advanced-controls/introduction/introduction-to-pid.html) to control the position of our intake/claw, a mechanism to help drivers grab **FOOD** balls. You can check this out in the [*Intake.java*](https://github.com/Allenyang16/FGC2024-TeamChina/blob/master/TeamCode/src/main/java/org/firstinspires/ftc/teamcode/subsystems/Intake.java).
